The Adapter design pattern in Java is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It's particularly useful when you have two existing interfaces that need to collaborate but can't directly do so due to their incompatible interfaces.


The Adapter design pattern in Java is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It's particularly useful when you have two existing interfaces that need to collaborate but can't directly do so due to their incompatible interfaces.

Here's a basic implementation of the Adapter pattern in Java:


**Target** is the desired interface that the client code expects to work with.

**Adaptee** is the existing class with an incompatible interface.

**Adapter** is the class that bridges between Target and Adaptee. It implements the Target interface and internally uses an instance of Adaptee to adapt its methods

**ProductPriceCalculator** is the existing interface for calculating the total cost of a product.

**DefaultProductPriceCalculator** is the existing implementation of the ProductPriceCalculator interface.

**CurrencyConverter** is the interface of the new system that converts currency.

**InrToUSDConverter** is the implementation of the CurrencyConverter interface that converts Euros to USD.

**CurrencyConverterAdapter** is the adapter class that adapts the CurrencyConverter interface to the ProductPriceCalculator interface.
