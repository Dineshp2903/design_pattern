The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem or set of interfaces. By using a Facade, you can hide the complexities of the underlying system and make it easier for clients to interact with it. This pattern promotes loose coupling between clients and subsystems by allowing clients to interact with the subsystem through a single, unified interface.
