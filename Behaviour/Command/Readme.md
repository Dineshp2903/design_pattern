The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
It also enables storing of these requests in queues, logs, etc., allowing for the support of undoable operations.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

**Command:** 
      This is an interface or an abstract class that declares the execute method.
      
      It typically has one or more parameters to pass any required data to the receiver object.
**Concrete Command:**

  These are implementations of the Command interface.
  
  Each concrete command binds together a receiver with a set of actions.
**Receiver:** 

  This is the object that performs the actual work when the command's execute method is called.
  
  It knows how to carry out the request.
**Invoker:** 
  
    This is the object that asks the command to carry out the request. 
    It does not know anything about a concrete command; it only knows the command interface.
**Client:**
  
  This sets up the command and the receiver. 
  It decides which commands to execute at which points. It creates a Concrete Command object and sets its receiver.
